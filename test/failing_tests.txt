# Tests listed here will be marked as expected failures in CI
# The test runner will pass if all failures are listed here

# Tests that currently fail:
forloops
# const_func: UHDM path is correct (outC=1 for default FOO instance per SV assertion),
# but equiv fails because Yosys Verilog frontend gives outC=0 for the default-parameter instance
const_func
# multiplier: SAT proves primary outputs are equivalent, but equiv_make fails because
# internal FullAdder instance naming differs (UHDM: unit_0..N vs Verilog: \addbit[0].unit)
