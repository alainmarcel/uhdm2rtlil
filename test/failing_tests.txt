# All tests are now working! The UHDM frontend successfully processes all test cases.
# Some tests have RTLIL differences compared to the Verilog frontend, but this is expected
# due to different source location tracking and intermediate representation differences.

# Key improvements made:
# - Fixed process signal extraction with fallback logic
# - Added support for bitwise operations (vpiBitAndOp, vpiBitOrOp, vpiBitXorOp, vpiBitNegOp)
# - Fixed parameter parsing for vpiUIntConst and vpiHexConst formats
# - Implemented comprehensive UHDM memory analysis pass with intermediate representation
# - Memory objects now generate proper RTLIL memory blocks instead of simple wires
