# Tests that currently fail:
forloops
# const_fold_func: 2 unproven equiv cells - out4[0] from recursive runtime function
# inlining produces wrong value, out6[1] side-effect on module port during compile-time eval
const_fold_func
# multiplier: SAT proves primary outputs are equivalent, but equiv_make fails because
# internal FullAdder instance naming differs (UHDM: unit_0..N vs Verilog: \addbit[0].unit)
