# Tests listed here will be marked as expected failures in CI
# The test runner will pass if all failures are listed here

# Tests that currently fail:
forloops
# const_fold_func: 2 unproven equiv cells - out4[0] from recursive runtime function
# inlining produces wrong value, out6[1] side-effect on module port during compile-time eval
const_fold_func
# multiplier: SAT proves primary outputs are equivalent, but equiv_make fails because
# internal FullAdder instance naming differs (UHDM: unit_0..N vs Verilog: \addbit[0].unit)
multiplier
# case_expr_const: UHDM fails to evaluate certain case-expression constants at compile time;
# g=1'h0 vs expected 1'h1, c/b=1'hx vs expected 1'h1
case_expr_const
# port_sign_extend: UHDM produces 1-bit output (1'h1) instead of 2-bit sign-extended (2'h2)
