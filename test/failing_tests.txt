# Failing tests that are expected to fail
# Format: one test directory name per line

# Tests listed here will be marked as expected failures in CI
# The test runner will pass if all failures are listed here

# Tests that currently fail:
forloops
# gen_test5: Surelog doesn't elaborate generate for-loops with multiplication-based
# genvar increment (step = step * CHUNK)
gen_test5
# multiplier: SAT proves primary outputs are equivalent, but equiv_make fails because
# internal FullAdder instance naming differs (UHDM: unit_0..N vs Verilog: \addbit[0].unit)
