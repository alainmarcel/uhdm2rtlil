# UHDM to RTLIL Frontend

![CI](https://github.com/username/uhdm2rtlil/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A Yosys frontend that enables SystemVerilog synthesis through UHDM (Universal Hardware Data Model) by converting UHDM representations to Yosys RTLIL (Register Transfer Level Intermediate Language).

> ### ✅ Every result is verified
> Nothing here is counted as "working" on a read-only or vacuous pass. Every

## Overview

This project bridges the gap between SystemVerilog source code and Yosys synthesis by leveraging two key components:

1. **Surelog** - Parses SystemVerilog and generates UHDM
2. **UHDM Frontend** - Converts UHDM to Yosys RTLIL

This enables full SystemVerilog synthesis capability in Yosys, including advanced features not available in Yosys's built-in Verilog frontend.

## Verification Methodology

Correctness is the project's first-class concern. Every test's SystemVerilog is
synthesized and then **independently verified** by one or more of:

1. **Formal equivalence (`equiv_induct`)** — the UHDM-frontend netlist is proven
   sequentially equivalent to the netlist produced by Yosys's own Verilog frontend
   (the golden reference), using `equiv_make` / `equiv_simple` / `equiv_induct`.
2. **Sound SAT-from-reset miter** — a bounded model-check from the reset state
   (`miter` + `sat -prove-asserts -seq N -set-init-zero`) that is **sound**: it
   never false-passes. It is the adjudicator of record — when `equiv_induct` can't
   close an inductive proof, the miter decides whether the two netlists are truly
   equivalent (an induction gap, *not* a bug) or genuinely divergent (a real bug).
3. **High-activity randomized Verilator co-simulation** — the UHDM-synthesized
   gate-level netlist is co-simulated against the original RTL under randomized,
   high-toggle-activity stimulus (all clocks driven, reset wiggled, activity
   guards) to catch functional divergences a vacuous stimulus would miss.

A result is only counted as **Correct** when formal equivalence and/or co-simulation
proves it; designs the native Verilog frontend cannot even parse ("SV-only") are
verified against the RTL by co-simulation, since there is no golden netlist to
compare against. This asymmetric, miter-adjudicated policy is why the tables below
report **0 Miter-Formal escapes** — no real UHDM≠Verilog difference slips through.

### Test Suite Status

Run via `make test-all --all` (the internal SystemVerilog suite **plus** the
upstream Yosys test suite under `third_party/yosys/tests/`):

- **Total Tests**: 1276
- **Success Rate**: 95% (1218/1276 tests functional), 2 crashes, **0 Miter-Formal
  escapes** (no UHDM≠Verilog diff slips past `equiv_induct`)
- **Passing**: 856 tests with formal equivalence verified between the UHDM and Verilog frontends
- **UHDM-Only Success**: 362 tests verified end-to-end against Verilator (the UHDM frontend handles SystemVerilog the Verilog frontend can't, so formal equivalence isn't possible — see below)
- **Equivalence failures**: 22 — all caught by `equiv_induct` (0 Miter-Formal
  escapes): internal `CastStructArray`, `rp32_r5p_mouse`, and four struct-array
  tests exposed by the Yosys v0.67 bump (`multidim_hier_path8`,
  `struct_array_indexed_write`, `struct_little_endian_bit_array`,
  `svtypes_struct_array`); plus 16 from the upstream Yosys suite
  (`arch/nanoxplore/meminit`, `check_mem/{init,non_zero,power_of_two,sub_addr}`,
  `sat/{alu,grom_computer,grom_cpu,ram_memory}`, `simple/{loops,module_scope_case}`,
  `sva/extnets`, `svtypes/{array_assign,struct_array}`, `verific/ext_ramnet_err`,
  `verilog/mem_bounds`).  The exact set varies run-to-run (seq-equiv induction is
  inductively incomplete on some designs).  NOTE `multidim_hier_path8` is a
  *genuine* UHDM≠Verilog bug (a range part-select of a packed struct-array field,
  `s.arr[hi:lo]`, zeroes the high output bits) that v0.67's now-correct
  `read_verilog` reference exposed — caught by `equiv_induct`, not an escape.
- **True failures** (no output generated): 13 — all from the upstream Yosys suite
  (`arch/fabulous/{arith,custom,ff,io,regfile}_map`, `functional/picorv32_tb`,
  `hana/test_simulation_vlib`, `opt/opt_rmdff`, `rpc/design`,
  `svinterfaces/{load_and_derive,resolve_types}`, `techmap/mem_simple_4x1_map`,
  `verific/mixed_flist`)
- **Crashes**: 2 (`memories/wide_all`, `techmap/recursive_map`)
- **Verilator sim-equiv warnings**: 100 (undocumented divergences — now hard errors
  unless documented in `test/sim_equiv_analyzed.txt`), plus **72 analyzed** known
  non-bug divergences — of which 58 are sim/synth artefacts where a SAT miter
  proves UHDM == Verilog, and the rest are uhdm-only don't-care divergences (e.g.
  `rp32_r5p_alu/wbu/mdu`, where the Verilog frontend can't synthesize the SV so no
  miter is possible)

> The **internal** SystemVerilog suite alone is **723 tests, 0 true failures,
> 0 crashes** — equivalence failures are `CastStructArray` (a
> Yosys-Verilog-frontend bug, not UHDM), `rp32_r5p_mouse` (the rp32 core,
> reset/X-dependent so not cleanly equiv-able), and four packed struct-array
> tests newly exposed by the Yosys v0.67 bump (`multidim_hier_path8` — a genuine
> UHDM `s.arr[hi:lo]` bug — plus `struct_array_indexed_write`,
> `struct_little_endian_bit_array`, `svtypes_struct_array`, which a SAT miter
> proves UHDM == Verilog, i.e. `equiv_induct` incompleteness, not real diffs). The
> figures above are the combined `--all` run; the remaining failures/crash come
> from the imported upstream Yosys suite (feature gaps / non-synthesizable
> constructs), tracked in `test/failing_tests.txt` and
> `test/imported_tests_status.txt` and fixed incrementally. No pre-existing
> internal test regressed.

### SystemVerilog Frontend Comparison

The 4-frontend regression matrix (`make test-matrix`, run nightly) synthesizes
every test's SystemVerilog through **four** frontends and ranks them by how much
SV each handles **correctly**. Every netlist is verified either by **formal
equivalence** — Yosys `equiv_induct` plus a sound SAT-from-reset miter, against
the Yosys Verilog-frontend golden — **and/or** by **high-activity randomized
Verilator co-simulation** against the original RTL. A result counts as *Correct*
only when one of those checks proves it equivalent; *SV-only* means the frontend
synthesized SystemVerilog that the native Verilog frontend cannot even read (no
golden to compare against, so it is verified against the RTL by co-simulation).

Ranked by total tests handled correctly (1237-test matrix):

| Rank | Frontend | Verified correct | SV-only (no golden) | **Total correct** | Incorrect | Failed to read |
|-----:|----------|-----------------:|--------------------:|------------------:|----------:|---------------:|
| 🥇 1 | **`uhdm`** (this project) | 814 | 293 | **1107 (89%)** | 25 | 37 |
| 🥈 2 | `sv2v` | 768 | 237 | 1005 (81%) | 0 | 175 |
| 🥉 3 | `slang` (Yosys sv-elab) | 640 | 243 | 883 (71%) | 0 | 242 |
| 4 | `verilog` (Yosys native, the golden) | 852 | — | 852 (69%) | 9 | 375 |

On this corpus the UHDM frontend converts the most SystemVerilog — **1107 of
1237** tests verified correct, including **293 designs the native Verilog frontend
cannot read at all**.

**How to read this table honestly:**

- **It is a self-run benchmark on a largely self-authored corpus.** The matrix is
  mostly this project's own test suite (plus imported Yosys and
  chipsalliance/UHDM-integration tests), and many tests were added specifically to
  exercise constructs this frontend targets. The ranking is real but it is *not* a
  neutral third-party comparison — a tool graded on the set its authors curated is
  playing at home. Read "#1 by ~18 points" in that light.
- **The benchmark rewards breadth over conservatism.** `sv2v` and `slang` report
  **0 incorrect** results here; `uhdm`'s **25** are a real (tracked) triage backlog
  in `test/failing_tests.txt`. The README's ranking metric (total handled) favors
  reading more SV, but "accepts less yet is never wrong on what it accepts" is a
  legitimate — sometimes preferable — posture, and it's the one `sv2v`/`slang` show
  on this corpus. Their higher "Failed to read" counts (175 / 242 vs 37) reflect
  that trade-off, not a defect.
- **Coverage ≠ ecosystem fit.** `slang`/sv-elab is the frontend that has been
  **upstreamed into Yosys itself**, ships in the OSS CAD Suite, and is used by
  OpenROAD — adoption, integration, and maintenance advantages a nightly coverage
  count does not capture. If your criterion is *maximum SV coverage through the
  Surelog/UHDM path today*, this table favors `uhdm`; if it is *what is maintained
  and integrated for production*, sv-elab has the stronger case. Both can be true.

`verilog` is the golden reference, so it has no *SV-only* column and its ceiling is
the SV subset it can parse. Numbers are from one nightly run and drift between runs
(seq-equiv induction is inductively incomplete on some designs) — treat any single
figure as approximate.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GCC/Clang compiler with C++17 support
- CMake 3.16+
- Python 3.6+
- Standard development tools (make, bison, flex)
- Verilator (used by `test/test_sim_equivalence.py` to co-simulate
  the original SV against the UHDM-derived netlist for tests where
  the Yosys Verilog frontend can't parse the source — see
  [Verilator-based simulation equivalence](#verilator-based-simulation-equivalence-check) below)

On Debian / Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
    build-essential cmake git python3 python3-pip pkg-config \
    libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libtcmalloc-minimal4 uuid-dev tcl-dev \
    libffi-dev libreadline-dev bison flex libfl-dev libunwind-dev \
    libgoogle-perftools-dev ccache help2man
```

`test/test_sim_equivalence.py` needs **Verilator 5.x** (5.020+) for SVA
parsing.  Ubuntu 24.04's stock `verilator` package is recent enough;
on older distros (22.04 ships 4.038) build from source:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 -b v5.048 https://github.com/verilator/verilator.git
cd verilator
autoconf
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
verilator --version  # confirm: "Verilator 5.048 ..."
```

### Build
```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/username/uhdm2rtlil.git
cd uhdm2rtlil

# Configure git hooks (prevents committing files >10MB)
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# Build everything (Surelog, Yosys, UHDM Frontend)
make
```

### Basic Usage

The plugin (`uhdm2rtlil.so`) registers two Yosys commands for getting
SystemVerilog into RTLIL:

| Command | Input | Surelog run | Intermediate `.uhdm` |
|---------|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **`read_sv`**   | SystemVerilog source(s) + Surelog flags | in-process | no — fully in-memory |
| **`read_uhdm`** | a pre-generated `.uhdm` file             | separate / earlier | yes |

#### `read_sv` — compile SystemVerilog directly (recommended)

Runs the Surelog compiler **in-process** and imports the elaborated in-memory
UHDM design straight to RTLIL, without writing or re-reading a `.uhdm` file.
All arguments are forwarded to Surelog verbatim, exactly as if it were the
`surelog` executable:

```bash
./out/current/bin/yosys -m uhdm2rtlil.so \
  -p "read_sv -parse -nobuiltin design.sv; synth -top top_module"

# Multi-file / flags work just like the surelog CLI:
#   read_sv -parse -nobuiltin a.sv b.sv +incdir+inc -DWIDTH=8 -top mytop
```

`read_sv` forces parse + elaborate + in-memory UHDM elaboration on and `.uhdm`
file writing off.  Pass any Surelog flag as usual; `-nobuiltin` is recommended
to skip Surelog's built-in classes.  Plugin-only options (consumed, not passed
to Surelog): `-uhdm_debug`, `-formal`, `-keep_names`.

#### `read_uhdm` — read a pre-generated UHDM file

Useful when the UHDM database was produced by a separate Surelog run (e.g. the
test workflow, or for caching/debugging the `.uhdm`):

```bash
# Step 1: Generate UHDM from SystemVerilog
./build/third_party/Surelog/bin/surelog -parse -d uhdm design.sv

# Step 2: Read the UHDM file with the frontend
./out/current/bin/yosys -m uhdm2rtlil.so \
  -p "read_uhdm slpp_all/surelog.uhdm; synth -top top_module"
```

Options: `-debug`, `-formal`, `-keep_names`.

#### Using the test workflow
```bash
cd test
bash test_uhdm_workflow.sh simple_counter
```

## Testing Framework

### Test Structure
Each test case is a directory containing:
- `dut.sv` - SystemVerilog design under test
- Automatically generated comparison files:
  - `*_from_uhdm.il` - RTLIL generated via UHDM path
  - `*_from_verilog.il` - RTLIL generated via Verilog path
  - `rtlil_diff.txt` - Detailed RTLIL comparison
  - `*_from_uhdm_synth.v` - Gate-level netlist via UHDM path
  - `*_from_verilog_synth.v` - Gate-level netlist via Verilog path
  - `netlist_diff.txt` - Gate-level netlist comparison

### Running Tests
```bash
# Smoke-test the read_sv command (in-process Surelog compile, no .uhdm file).
# Verifies read_sv == Verilog frontend and that no .uhdm is written.  Fast;
# CI runs this first, and `make test` runs it as part of the suite.
make test-read-sv

# Run internal tests only (our test suite; includes test-read-sv)
make test

# Run all tests (internal + Yosys tests)
make test-all

# Run Yosys tests only
make test-yosys

# Run specific test from test directory
cd test
bash test_uhdm_workflow.sh simple_counter

# Run tests with options from test directory
cd test
bash run_all_tests.sh                    # Run internal tests only
bash run_all_tests.sh --all              # Run all tests (internal + Yosys)
bash run_all_tests.sh --yosys           # Run all Yosys tests
bash run_all_tests.sh --yosys add_sub   # Run specific Yosys test pattern

# Test output explanation:
# ✓ PASSED - UHDM and Verilog frontends produce functionally equivalent results
# ⚠ FUNCTIONAL - Works correctly but with RTLIL differences (normal and expected)
# ✗ FAILED - Significant functional differences or equivalence check failure

# The test framework performs multiple levels of comparison:
# 1. RTLIL comparison - Shows implementation differences
# 2. Synthesis and formal equivalence check - Uses Yosys equiv_make/equiv_simple/equiv_induct
# 3. Validates functional equivalence even when gate counts differ
```

### Yosys Test Integration

The UHDM frontend can run the full Yosys test suite to validate compatibility:

```bash
# Run all Yosys tests
make test-yosys

# Run specific Yosys test directory
cd test
./run_all_tests.sh --yosys ../third_party/yosys/tests/arch/common

# Run specific Yosys test
./run_all_tests.sh --yosys ../third_party/yosys/tests/arch/common/add_sub.v
```

### Verilator-based Simulation Equivalence Check

UHDM-only tests have no Yosys-Verilog-frontend reference netlist to formally
equivalence-check against, so `run_all_tests.sh` invokes
`test/test_sim_equivalence.py` on them as a soft warning.

The script co-simulates two views of the same design under Verilator:

  - **RTL form**  — the original `dut.sv`, simulated directly by Verilator
  - **Netlist**   — UHDM frontend output, post-`synth -auto-top`

A small SystemVerilog testbench instantiates both side by side
(`dut_rtl` / `dut_netlist`), and a C++ driver advances clocks, holds
reset for a few cycles, then drives random inputs for ~50–200 cycles,
comparing every output every cycle.  Clocks and resets are extracted
from the netlist via the `extract_clocks_resets` Yosys plugin
(`build/extract_clocks_resets.so`).

A mismatch surfaces as a `⚠️ Verilator co-sim WARNING` line in the
test summary and does **not** flip the test to failed.  Per-test
output is written to `<test_dir>/sim_equiv.log`.

You can also run it standalone:
```bash
cd test
./test_sim_equivalence.py setundef
```

The Yosys test runner:
- Automatically finds self-contained Verilog/SystemVerilog tests
- Runs both Verilog and UHDM frontends on each test
- Performs formal equivalence checking when both frontends succeed
- Reports UHDM-only successes (tests that only work with UHDM frontend)
- Creates test results in `test/run/` directory structure

### Test Categories

The internal suite spans flip-flops & registers, counters, combinational/boolean/
arithmetic logic, multiplexers, multipliers & pipelines, state machines, functions,
scope & variable shadowing, arrays & memory, data types & structs, generate &
parameterization, module hierarchy & interfaces, and primitives.

**See [`docs/test-cases.md`](docs/test-cases.md) for the full annotated catalog.**

### Test Management

The test framework includes automatic handling of known failing tests:

```bash
# View known failing tests
cat test/failing_tests.txt

# Format: one test name per line, # for comments
```

**How it works:**
- Tests listed in `failing_tests.txt` are expected to fail
- The test runner (`run_all_tests.sh`) will still run these tests
- If all failures are listed in `failing_tests.txt`, the test suite passes with exit code 0
- This allows CI to pass while acknowledging known issues
- New unexpected failures will cause the test suite to fail

**Current Status:** see the authoritative figures under
[Verification Methodology → Test Suite Status](#test-suite-status). In short: the
internal SystemVerilog suite passes with 0 true failures / 0 crashes, and
`failing_tests.txt` documents the known expected-fail cases from the imported
upstream-Yosys suite (feature gaps, non-DUT techmap files, and equiv_induct
incompleteness that the SAT miter proves equivalent) — it is **not** empty.

### Important Test Workflow Note

The test workflow runs `proc` before `opt` to ensure proper process handling:
```tcl
hierarchy -check -top $MODULE_NAME
stat
proc    # Convert processes to netlists first
opt     # Then optimize
stat
write_rtlil ${MODULE_NAME}_from_uhdm.il
synth -top $MODULE_NAME
```

This prevents errors when synthesizing designs with generate blocks and multiple processes.

## Test Results

The authoritative, up-to-date figures live in one place —
[Verification Methodology → Test Suite Status](#test-suite-status) and the
[SystemVerilog Frontend Comparison](#systemverilog-frontend-comparison) leaderboard
— to avoid the numeric drift that comes from repeating counts in several sections.
Any single figure is from one nightly run and is approximate.

## Recent Improvements

The frontend has landed a large number of incremental SystemVerilog features and
bug fixes — unpacked-array ports, packed multidimensional arrays, packed unions,
struct-field-parameter dimensions, function-local arrays, for-loop unrolling, memory
inference, signedness/sign-extension, interfaces, techmap cells, and many more.

**The full, annotated changelog lives in**
**[`docs/recent-improvements.md`](docs/recent-improvements.md).**

## Development Workflow

### Adding SystemVerilog Support
1. **Identify UHDM Objects**: Determine which UHDM object types represent the feature
2. **Implement Import**: Add handling in appropriate `src/frontends/uhdm/*.cpp` file
3. **Map to RTLIL**: Convert UHDM objects to equivalent RTLIL constructs
4. **Add Tests**: Create test cases comparing UHDM vs Verilog frontend outputs
5. **Validate**: Ensure generated RTLIL produces correct synthesis results

### Development Setup

#### Git Hooks
The project includes Git hooks to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Enable Git hooks (one-time setup)
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# What the hooks do:
# - Prevent commits of files larger than 10MB
# - Prevent commits of test/run/**/*.v files (generated test outputs)
```

### Debugging
```bash
# Enable debug output
export YOSYS_ENABLE_UHDM_DEBUG=1

# Run with verbose logging
./out/current/bin/yosys -p "read_uhdm -debug design.uhdm; write_rtlil output.il"
```

### Key Design Principles
- **Correctness**: Generated RTLIL must be functionally equivalent to Verilog frontend
- **Completeness**: Support full SystemVerilog feature set over time
- **Performance**: Efficient UHDM traversal and RTLIL generation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between different handlers

## Development Approach: AI-Assisted Implementation

This project is developed using an innovative AI-assisted approach with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). The development workflow leverages Claude's ability to understand and work with multiple file formats simultaneously:

### How It Works

1. **UHDM Text Analysis**: Claude analyzes the UHDM text output (from `uhdm-dump`) to understand the structure and relationships of SystemVerilog constructs as represented in UHDM.

2. **RTLIL Comparison**: The `.il` files generated by both the UHDM frontend and Verilog frontend are compared to identify differences and ensure functional equivalence.

3. **Iterative Development**: Claude can:
   - Read UHDM dumps to understand what objects need to be handled
   - Analyze RTLIL differences to identify missing functionality
   - Suggest and implement fixes based on the patterns observed
   - Test changes and iterate until the outputs match

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate UHDM and dump it for analysis
./build/third_party/Surelog/bin/surelog -parse test.sv
./build/third_party/UHDM/bin/uhdm-dump slpp_all/surelog.uhdm > test.uhdm.txt

# 2. Generate RTLIL from both frontends
yosys -p "read_uhdm slpp_all/surelog.uhdm; write_rtlil test_uhdm.il"
yosys -p "read_verilog test.sv; write_rtlil test_verilog.il"

# 3. Claude analyzes:
# - test.uhdm.txt to understand UHDM structure
# - Differences between test_uhdm.il and test_verilog.il
# - Implements necessary handlers in the frontend code
```

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Rapid Development**: Claude can quickly identify patterns and implement handlers
- **Comprehensive Understanding**: AI can analyze complex relationships across multiple file formats
- **Systematic Coverage**: Each test case systematically expands SystemVerilog support
- **Quality Assurance**: Comparing against Yosys's Verilog frontend ensures correctness

This "vibe coding" approach has proven highly effective, enabling the implementation of complex SystemVerilog features like packages, interfaces, and generate blocks in a fraction of the traditional development time.
